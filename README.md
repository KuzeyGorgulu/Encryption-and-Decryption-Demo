# Encryption and Decryption Demo

This is a simple Python project to demonstrate the encryption and decryption of a password using the `cryptography` library.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that handles the encryption and decryption process.
- `key.key`: A file containing the encryption key.
- `password.txt`: A file containing the encrypted password.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library

You can install the required library using pip:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/encryption-decryption-demo.git
cd encryption-decryption-demo
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary files:

- `key.key` should contain the encryption key.
- `password.txt` should contain the encrypted password.

3. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```
This will decrypt the password stored in `password.txt `and print it to the console.

## Example

Here is an example output of running the script:

```bash
Decrypted password: your_password_here
```

## Security Condiserations

-Keep your `key.key` file secure: The encryption key is critical for decrypting your data. Do not share it publicly.
